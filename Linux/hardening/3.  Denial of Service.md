Crash la VM debian 12

```bash
$0 && $0 $
```


The command `$0 && $0 $` is likely causing your system to crash due to an infinite loop known as a "fork bomb" [1](https://superuser.com/questions/259883/why-this-command-crashes-linux).

In a fork bomb, a process continually replicates itself to spawn new processes, consuming system resources until the system becomes unstable or crashes. In your case, `$0 && $0 $` is essentially saying "execute this script, and if successful, execute it again", which leads to the script repeatedly calling itself without any termination condition, leading to an explosion of processes [1](https://superuser.com/questions/259883/why-this-command-crashes-linux).
