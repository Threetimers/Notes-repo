### Explications visudo Syntax
The statement `myuser ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL` is a rule in the `sudoers` file, which grants the user `myuser` all sudo privileges. Let's break down what each part of this statement means:

- `myuser`: This is the user that the rule applies to. It could be a specific username or a group name prefixed with `%`.

- `ALL`: This is the host that the rule applies to. `ALL` means the rule applies to all hosts.

- `(ALL:ALL)`: This is the `Runas` field. It specifies which users and groups the user can run commands as. `ALL:ALL` means the user can run commands as any user or group.

- `ALL`: This is the command field. `ALL` means the user can run all commands.

So, the entire statement `myuser ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL` means that the user `myuser` can run all commands as any user or group on all hosts [Source 0][Source 1].

This kind of rule is typically placed in the `sudoers` file to grant a user administrative privileges. You can add this rule to the `sudoers` file using the `visudo` command, which ensures the correct syntax and prevents syntax errors from locking you out of your system [Source 1].
